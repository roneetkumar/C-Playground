Use 2 text files (clients. txt and accounts. txt) where you store informations about clients (who can have many accounts).

Your application will simulate an ATM machine, that will allow a client to :
- login (with client number and password),
- select account type,
- select transaction type (deposit, withdraw and consult),
- terminate transaction (update files).
